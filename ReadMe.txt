2-Every play will request a new Ip adress from the Tor Network

3-There is an explenation with # to pretty much everything the script is doing 

4-The only libs you'll need are Pyautogui, go get it open commandline run: 

     pip install PyAutoGUI

6-MAKE SURE TOR IS CLOSED BEFORE YOU RUN THE SCRIPT.
