This is a pretty simple yet effective script to play a video on loop on youtube or song on  soundcloud for example

Every play will request a new Ip adress from the Tor Network

There is an explenation with # to pretty much everything the script is doing 

The only libs you'll need are Pyautogui, go get it open commandline run: 

     pip install PyAutoGUI


the rest is pretty self explenatory in the example


thankÂ´s I hope this is usefull :)
